Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

with a small number of simulations, N less than number of teams (10), some teams do not even show a probability of winning.
The most likely to win teams can show up to 30% chance of winning for a team that would not likely to show at the top of
the list i.e. Argentina.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Predictions stabalised after N = 1000 (although results were somewhat converged at N = 100).
I would call "good" enough at N = 1000
