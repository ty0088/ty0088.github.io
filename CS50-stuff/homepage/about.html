            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>
                I was previously a Mechanical Engineer, having graduated with a Masters of Engineering and having worked in several traditional engineering firms, 
                large and small, multi-national to government. I have always had a interest and passion for technology and have always been into computers, 
                gaming, software but only as a hobby. My only professional experience of software development was creating a physics based analysis program in 
                FORTRAN during an industrial placement year during university and also using Python to automate some data collection from a sensor during 
                product testing.

            <h3>Why web development?</h3>
            <p>
                I decided it was a career I wanted to persue, having always had an interest in software development and having been on the look out for jobs, 
                workplaces and environments that were at the forefront of technology that cared about employee wellbeing and had a culture of responsibility. 
                Whilst tradition engineering roles could be at the forefront of technology, the environments and culture at a lot of traditional engineering 
                firms are stuck about 30-50 years in the past. Web development happened to be the one that I found the most accessible and also I found an 
                online course I really liked which was in web development. 
            </p>

            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>
                I decided I wanted to do a self-taught course, rather than go to bootcamp and I initally used <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>
                to teach myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Whilst it was a great learning resource, I found it didn't suit my style of learning and I wasn't enjoying the
                constant checking of code against a "model" answer. I then found <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> which had a JavaScript
                based course and it was exactly what I was after. It is less hand holding and promotes independent learning and project building. 
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Now...</h3>
            <p>
                After completing The Odin Project JavaScript path, I am now actively looking for jobs as a web developer. To fill in the time between job hunting, I am
                going back to basics and doing the Harvard <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">CS50x web development course</a>. This course is more of a beginners
                introduction to computer science and web development.
