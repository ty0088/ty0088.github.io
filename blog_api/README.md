# The Blog Spot API

## Live Access
A live implementation of this web app can be found at https://blog-api.ty0088.co.uk. The API is hosted using AWS Elastic Beanstalk through my own domain.

## Project Description
"The Blog Spot API" is an ExpressJS/Node RESTful backend API for "The Blog Spot" web apps. Separate frontend web apps use this backend API to access and manage the apps' data ([The Blog Spot - Reader](https://github.com/ty0088/ty0088.github.io/tree/main/blog_reader) and [The Blog Spot - Author](https://github.com/ty0088/ty0088.github.io/tree/main/blog_author)).

## Project Features
* User authentication - user authentication is provided through the use of passportJS and jwt cookie.
* 

## Purpose
This web app was created as part of my self-learning on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), specifically on the use and creation of APIs. The seperation of the frontend and backend and use of an API increases the flexibility and usability of the code and it's use. As demonstrated, several different frontends can take advantage of the backend API, such as different frontends for different users and also different types of frontend codes using the one backend. For example, both a web app or mobile app can use the same backend.

## Future
In it's current state, there are no further plans to develop this web app. For the purposes of learning and this portfolio, it is simply not necessary.

## How to Use this Project
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm serverstart` - for dev mode/debugging
or
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
