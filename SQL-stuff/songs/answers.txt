Purple aura with higher energy and danceability with a middle level of valence (positive/negative).

The averages are based only on the top 100 songs, with each song having an equal share of the average.
For example, we don't know how often each song is listened to. So a weight could be assigned to each song,
depending on how much it is listened to. If a song is listened to more than others, it should have more effect.

Also, the top 100 songs may not be a large enough sample size or just using just 3 characteristic values
(energy, danceability and valence) may not be enough. You could base it on the top 25% of songs for example,
so if a person has a very large library of songs, a larger sample would be taken. Or include more values such as tempo.
